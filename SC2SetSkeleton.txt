My husband and I are the founders of the Ledge Foundation.  It's both an open gaming foundation for organized play and a social enterprise for game-based learning.  We both have strong technical backgrounds, with degrees in mathematics and science, and over 15 years of combined work experience in highly-technical fields.  Our interests are wider, however, and we feel that we can contribute creatively to the community as well.  Art, game design, and film are popular topics of discussion in our house, we'd enjoy learning from or continuing these discussions with others.  If members of the CoCoon community are eager to play games, we'll probably organize some in our free time.

I've been studying genetics and evolutionary biology for over a decade.  I believe that in our lifetimes we will realize the potential of personalized medicine by applying statistical learning and other big data analytic techniques to genetic and epigenetic data that's already out there.  Half the battle will be teaching others about the unique challenges of genetic and evolutionary research, and so I'm exciting to apply a more popular science approach through game-based learning, engagement, and retention.

My husband has been working with the OpenCog Foundation for many years now, and so his primary experience with entrepreneurship has been through open source initiatives.  Before that he worked as the Technical Director at XMG Studio, a mobile gaming startup in Toronto.  His dream is to use the artificial general intelligence from projects such as OpenCog to create meaningful, self-aware games unlike anything in existence today.  Of course, if an open source AGI framework is completed in the near future, then there may be other more meaningful endeavours to apply it to, but that's another story...
